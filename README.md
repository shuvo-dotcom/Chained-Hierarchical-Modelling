# Hierarchical Multi-Output Modeling Pipeline

## Overview

This repository contains a robust and flexible hierarchical multi-output modeling pipeline designed to manage complex data processing, modeling, and evaluation tasks. The pipeline integrates components for data ingestion, preprocessing, hierarchical neural network modeling, task-specific output management, evaluation, optimization, and extensive logging and validation.

## Pipeline Components

### Data Handling

- **Input Layer**: Handles data ingestion, validation, feature scaling, and preparation.
- **Data Preprocessor**: Cleans and transforms data (e.g., normalization, encoding, dimensionality reduction).

### Model Architecture

- **Shared Layers**: Extract common features and learn shared patterns.
- **Task-Specific Layers**: Manage specialized processing for each individual output.
- **Output Integration**: Consolidates outputs, applies post-processing, and produces final predictions.

### Training and Evaluation

- **Model Trainer**: Executes training, optimization, early stopping, and checkpointing.
- **Evaluation Module**: Conducts performance assessments, error analysis, and reporting.

### Hierarchical Management

- **Root Component**: Oversees the entire hierarchical modeling structure.
- **Parent and Child Nodes**: Facilitate data flow and specialized task execution within hierarchy levels.
- **Hierarchy Manager**: Maintains node relationships, dependency management, and structure integrity.

### System Integration

- **Data Router**: Distributes input data efficiently throughout the hierarchy.
- **State Synchronizer**: Ensures consistency across nodes, manages recovery, and resolves conflicts.
- **Model Optimizer**: Continuously tunes hyperparameters and optimizes resources.
- **Validation Engine**: Performs rigorous validation across hierarchical levels.
- **Logging System**: Tracks system events, performance metrics, and generates alerts.

## Connector Types

- **Root Connector**: Integrates external systems with the pipeline.
- **Parent-Child Connector**: Manages hierarchical communication and data flow.
- **Sibling Connector**: Facilitates peer-level data sharing and synchronization.
- **Upward Connector**: Routes results and statuses from lower to upper hierarchy levels.
- **Optimization and Validation Connectors**: Connect nodes to respective optimization and validation systems.

## Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Pipeline
```bash
python hierarchical_main.py
```

### Configuration

Adjust configurations in the designated configuration files or directly within the pipeline's entry script (`hierarchical_main.py`).
